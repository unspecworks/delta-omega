## How to Order

This guide is written based on **[JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com)**. While other PCB manufacturers may differ slightly, most ordering steps are very similar.

To place an order, you will need the **Gerber archive**. Simply upload the ZIP file found in [./gerbers/](./gerbers/) to the JLCPCB order page.

> [!NOTE]
> In JLCPCBâ€™s Gerber Viewer, the edge cuts for hand-soldering switch may not appear. This is a known JLCPCB viewer issue and does **not** affect the actual manufacturing.
